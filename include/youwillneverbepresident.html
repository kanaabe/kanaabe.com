	<p class="web-project-description">You Will Never Be President is based on the idea that your digital footprint carries with you everywhere. Somewhere out there, is an embarrassing photo of you partying in 2009 or a tweet that's just a little offensive. Some of these moments might be lost in your subconscious but don't worry, we're here to help.
	<br><br>
	We'll show you the obscene tweets and facebook statuses that you may have forgotten about. Oh, and old photos too! We determine a negative photo by iterating through comments for profanity. Finally, we'll calculate a "Social Gravescore" which tells you just how obscene of a person your social past has been.

	Note: Facebook Authentication is still pending review. Try out the twitter feature!
