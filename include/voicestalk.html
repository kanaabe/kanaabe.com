	<img src="" class="web-project-image"></a>

	With Voice Stalk, you can stalk your friends without typing anything. Just click the button and tell us who you want to stalk. Note: the person you want to stalk must be a Flatiron School Ruby-006 member.

	Voice Stalk uses Wit.ai for voice recognition. We trained each of our classmate's names to recognize and pull data from their Twitter and Github accounts.

	Voice Stalk was created by Cassie Tarakajian and I.
