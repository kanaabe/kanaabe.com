  Stalk your friends without typing anything. Just click the button and tell us who you want to stalk.
  </br></br>
  Voice Stalk uses Wit.ai for voice recognition. We trained each of our classmate's names to recognize and pull data from their Twitter and Github accounts.

  Voice Stalk was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/hellothisiscass">Cassie Tarakajian</a> and I.
