	With Voice Stalk, you can stalk your friends without typing anything. Just click the button and tell us who you want to stalk. Note: the person you want to stalk must be a Flatiron School Ruby-006 member. 
	</br></br>
	Voice Stalk uses Wit.ai for voice recognition. We trained each of our classmate's names to recognize and pull data from their Twitter and Github accounts.

	Voice Stalk was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/hellothisiscass">Cassie Tarakajian</a> and I.
