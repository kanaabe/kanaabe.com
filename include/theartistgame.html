	<p class="web-project-description">
	Similar to The Wikipedia Game, players (one or more) start by selecting two artists or specific artworks. The goal is to traverse through the first artist/artwork page to arrive at the second artist/artwork in the least amount of time. 
	<br><br>
	It is an explorative and learning game aiming to playfully recognize relationships between art entities.
