  I am an engineer lead on the Publishing Product Team. We support our in-house writers with a backend publishing CMS tool, called <a href="https://github.com/artsy/positron">Writer</a>. I also support various parts of the front-end which include <a href="https://github.com/artsy/force">Force</a> and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/microgravity">Microgravity</a>. Both Writer and Force are OSS!
