	FiveEasyPayments was made at The Flatiron School as part of our final projects. This app uses the Venmo API to provide a user with a more in-depth view of their Venmo activity. It includes a D3 visualization and a "Venmo Credit Score" which we generate to show you how well you've paid off your friends. 

	Venmo hasn't approved our app so the above link is generated with sample data. 

	FiveEasyPayments is created by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/natekratchman">Nate Kratchman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/benjagross">Benjamin Gross</a> and myself.
