	We made FiveEasyPayments at The Flatiron School for one of our final projects. This app uses the Venmo API and provides users with a deep view of their Venmo finances. It includes a D3 visualization and a "Venmo Credit Score" which we generate to show you how well you've paid off your friends.

	FiveEasyPayments is created by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/natekratchman">Nate Kratchman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/benjagross">Benjamin Gross</a> and myself.
